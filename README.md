Some tinkering with an oldschool adventure game called Universe from Core, released in 1994.

What im trying to do :

Trying to parse and dump the filestructure, and maybe one day decompress the files.

This wikipage would probably explain it in more details:

Building:

you need to have a copy of the universe game.

1) place the UNIVERSE.EPF file with the code.
2) g++ main.cpp -o universe
3) run the compiled file.
